This app is a Product Reviews Platform that allows users to view products, rate them (1-5 stars), and add reviews with text, title, and images. It uses Supabase for the database (storing users, products, reviews, and ratings) and Cloudinary for image uploads. Users can register, browse products, submit ratings and reviews, and view all reviews for each product through a web interface. The app is designed for easy setup and online hosting, leveraging Supabase's PostgreSQL compatibility and Cloudinary's media management.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)

***Note**: This application uses **Supabase instead of a traditional PostgreSQL database**. As we needed to host it on a platform, an online database service like Supabase is preferred. Although **Supabase supports PostgreSQL, it provides a more convenient setup for web applications**.*

4. Set up database schema:
   - Go to Supabase SQL Editor
